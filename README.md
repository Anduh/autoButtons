# autoButtons
autoButtons API script for Roll20

### [Latest version](https://github.com/ooshhub/autoButtons/blob/main/autoButtons.js) - [Download](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/ooshhub/autoButtons/blob/main/autoButtons.js)

* *IMPORTANT: This script requires tokenMod to apply damage & healing to tokens. I could recreate the functions for all that but.... surely the Venn diagram of "people installing API scripts" and "people without tokenMod" is just two distant, lonely circles?* *

## CLI Commands
**Keyword:** !autoButton


**--listButtons / --buttons**  
    Generates a list of buttons currently available for use, e.g:

```!autoButton --buttons```

![buttonList](https://i.ibb.co/k0ZvvPX/med.png)

From left to right, the controls are "Show button", "Hide button", "Delete 
button". Controls are greyed out when nonsensical - you can't "Show" a 
button which is already shown on the button template, and you cannot 
"Hide" a button which isn't currently enabled.
